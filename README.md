## Tooling

See [./labs/lab_01/README.md](./labs/lab_01/README.md) for a rundown of minimal tooling. This section here contains some cool extra stuff.

### IntelliJ

Got problems importing your project? Head over to the [`Importing an SBT project into IntelliJ`](./importing-a-project.md)

### scalafmt

It is *the* way to format your code. By defining a file [`.scalafmt.conf`](./.scalafmt.conf) in the root of your project you can start using it via the sbt-plugin (check the [project/plugins.sbt](./project/plugins.sbt) file), or via the IntelliJ plugin. Follow the screenshots bellow to install the latter.

Go to `File -> Preferences`:
![Install Scalafmt IntelliJ Plugin](./screenshots/scalafmt_plugin_01.png)

Once you restart IntelliJ, `scalafmt` is available in the "Code" menu:
![Reformat with scalafmt](./screenshots/scalafmt_plugin_02.png)

By default it doesn't have a hotkey, assign one from the keymap menu. I also removed the IntelliJ formatter hotkey, and assigned it to `scalafmt`:

### scalafix

Scalafix is a much needed tool to automate code transformations. If you look into the [.scalafix.conf](./.scalafix.conf) you will see that currently the only enabled rule is `RemoveUnusedImports` (IntelliJ's kinda fails from time to time). Run `scalafix` from the SBT console ocassionaly.
